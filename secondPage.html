            On the western shore of Staten Island, one of the five boroughs of New York City, once sat four colossal heaps of garbage. 
            The trash piles were so tall that they rivaled the highest points on the Atlantic seaboard. 
            Fresh Kills Landfill, where New Yorkers deposited their trash for more than 50 years, finally closed in March 2001. 
            Fifty years' worth of garbage is spread out over almost 3,000 acres. 
            Twenty-five Yankee Stadiums fit into this land area, and it was rumored that like the Great Wall of China, the landfill was visible from space.
            </p>

            <p>
            The name Fresh Kills means "fresh water," called this by the Dutch settlers who arrived on Staten Island in the early 1600s. 
            At the time, the area comprised tidal creeks, wetlands, and teeming wildlife.
            </p>
            
            <p>Originally opened in 1948 to accept waste from highway construction, Fresh Kills Landfill was supposed to be active for three years. 
            However, the city kept extending its permit to remain open, year by year. 
            By 1965, the city had refused to set a closing date for the landfill because no viable alternatives could be found. 
            Staten Islanders were outraged to have their borough used as the city's dumping ground.
            </p>

            <p>While it was still operating, Fresh Kills accepted garbage 24 hours a day, six days a week. 
            By 1986, nearly 22,000 tons of solid waste were brought to the dump per day. All this resulted in four stinking, 
            rotting mounds of trash that reached higher than a 20-story building in some spots. 
            Cranes unloaded the waste at the top of the piles, spreading it in layers, compacting it with special equipment, 
            then covering it with a thin layer of dirt.

            <p>City officials insisted that there was plenty of dumping space left in Fresh Kills. 
            But the citizens of Staten Island had other ideas. 
            In the late 1990's, local political forces finally aligned and united to close the site for good. 
            By 1997, half of the landfill had been closed, and two of the mounds were covered with an impermeable cap.
            Although the landfill officially closed on March 23, 2001, one of the mounds was re-opened to accept rubble and debris from the World Trade Center disaster. 
            </p>

            <p>After Fresh Kills closed, the city of New York sponsored an international design contest to create an innovative new use for the location. 
            The idea was to transform the site into a world-class recreational area. 
            The landscape architecture firm James Corner Field Operations won the competition.
            Under their proposal, areas of the park would be set aside for leisure activities such as art exhibitions, hiking, biking, bird-watching and more. 
            In October 2010, the first large-scale public event was held at Freshkills Park. 
            In 2011, the NY Departments of Sanitation and Parks & Recreation celebrated the 10th anniversary of the landfill closure. 
            A barge loaded with young trees was delivered to the site on this occasion.
