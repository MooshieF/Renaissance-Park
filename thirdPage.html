            <h4>Park Sections</h4>
                <p>Freshkills Park will consist of five main areas: the Confluence (made up of Creek Landing and The Point), North Park, South Park, East Park and West Park. 
                Each area will have a distinct character and programming approach.
                </p>
                
                <p> At 2,200 acres, the Park is being worked on in stages, starting from the outside in. 
                Several areas, including Owl Hollow Fields and Schmul Park, are already open to the community. 
                Owl Hollow Fields has four soccer fields. The New Springville Greenway, located on the Richmond Avenue edge of Freshkills Park, features a multi-use path. 
                Soon, visitors will have access to the wetlands, meadows and incomparable vistas of the North Park and East Park sections.
                </p>
            
                <p>Once it is complete, Freshkills Park will be almost three times the size of Central Park. 
                </p>
            
            <h4>Public Safety</h4>
                <p>The Department of Sanitation of New York is in charge of closing the landfill, with strict oversight by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. 
                All of the garbage will be sealed under an impermeable landfill cap. 
                The DSNY will continue to monitor the site for safety for a minimum of 30 years.
                A landfill gas collection system extracts methane gas, which is then used as energy for Staten Island homes. 
                Additionally, leachate from the mounds is collected and sent to an on-site plant for treatment.
                </p>
            
            <h4>Biodiversity</h4>
                <p>Freshkills Park supports diverse habitats for wildlife, birds and plant communities.
                These habitats include salt marsh, tidal creeks, and grasslands.
                Native plant sites provide homes for birds such as glossy ibis, bald eagles, and osprey. 
                Muskrats, rabbits, deer and several varieties of turtles can also be found here. 
                </p>
            
            <h4>The Future of the Park</h4>
               
                <p>The buildout will take many years to complete, but it will be worth the wait. 
                This huge area will feature a variety of public spaces and facilities for social, cultural and physical activities. 
                Visitors will enjoy sports and programs that are unusual in the city, including kayaking, horseback riding, and large scale public art exhibits.
                </p>
            
                <p>An extensive network of paths, recreational waterways and drives will create a unique experience for park guests,
                who will have access to the site by bike or kayak, on horseback, on foot, or by car.
                </p>
                
                <p>The transformation of this former garbage dump into a beautiful natural area serves as a symbol of renewal, environmental sustainability 
                and public concern for our species' impact on the earth.
